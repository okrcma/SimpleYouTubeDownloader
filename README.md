# Simple YouTube Downloader

This is a minimal downloader for YouTube videos. It is meant as an example of how 
you can query the YouTube API to get a URL for a video and download the video.
It is NOT meant to actually be used as a user-friendly downloader. At best, it will
download the video in a not-so-great quality, and in some cases it will not download 
anything. That's because to get a good downloader, you need to solve many, many, 
MANY edge cases (and such downloaders already exist). But if you want to just play 
around with code for downloading videos, then this is a good starting point.
